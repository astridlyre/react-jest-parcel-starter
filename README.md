# React & Parcel Starter

This is a simple React app starter, using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/docs/)
as a bundler. I couldn't find the perfect starter, so I made this one. It also
features [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing, which was a little tricky to
get working with Parcel.

```bash
# Run Development Environment
pnpm run dev

# Build for Production
pnpm run build

# Test
pnpm run test
```
