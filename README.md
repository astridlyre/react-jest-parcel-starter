# React & Parcel Starter

This is a simple React app starter, using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/docs/)
as a bundler. I couldn't find the perfect starter, so I made this one. It also
features [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/)
for testing, which was a little tricky to get working with Parcel.

## Getting started

Simply clone the repo and get to work:

```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/astridlyre/react-jest-parcel-starter' .
```

## Features

- React
- Jest
- `Normalize.css`, along with a minimal modern CSS reset
- Support for CSS modules
- Parcel
- Testing library

```bash
# Run Development Environment
pnpm run dev

# Build for Production
pnpm run build

# Test
pnpm run test
```
